# traffic-monitoring-display
This is the Traffic Monitoring Display for the Final Project of my Multitier Web Architecture class. 
Once you have all of the projects nececary for the Traffic Manager portion of the application you must start this application
after starting the Traffic Manager and ais-transmitter. After all of the applications have been started then you must navigate
to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser or whatever port you select.
